//Welcome to challenge #1

/*
This is a simple test where you write a program that can
play a game called fizzbuzz.

FizzBuzz:

Ok so here is how the game works 
you have to say every number from 1 to 
100 (hint a for loop). If a number is divisible by 
3 you say Fizz instead. For example don't say 6 you say Fizz.
If a number is divisible by 5 then you say Buzz and if its 
divisible by both 3 and 5 you say FizzBuzz

here is an example 0f 1-15

1
2
Fizz (3)
4
Buzz (5)
Fizz  (6)
7
8
Fizz (9)
Buzz (10)
11
Fizz (12)
13
14
FizzBuzz (15)

the tools you will need:


1 for loop 
1 if 
2 else ifs 
2 else

also to do a test if a number is divisible use
the % (under the 5) .
examples:

6 % 2 = 0
5 % 2 =  1 (The answer is the remainder)
11% 3 = 2
use == to test if too number are equal

it will be also useful to know how to use an if statement with two conditions

if(i == 1 && h == 2) {
   //this code will only run if i is equal to 1 and is h = to 2

}

void setup() {
  //Put your Fizzbuzz Code here not in the loop
  Serial.begin(9600);
  //start here:
  
  //start with a for loop
  
  
  
  //first check for FizzBuzz % 3 && % 5
  
  
  
   //check for Fizz % 3
   
   
   //now check for Buzz % 5
   
   
   
   //if its not Fizz or Buzz then we want to print the number (all else fails)
  

}

void loop() {
  //Do not put any code here! 
  
}
